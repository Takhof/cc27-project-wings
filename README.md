# cc27-project-wings

This is a project to create a Code Chrysalis social network. 

Our team took the project over from the preivous team to improve upon.

## Available Scripts

`npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode

## Dependencies

React, React-Routes, Express, Knex, PG,

## Dev Dependencies

Nodemon

## Setup

Run `npm install`

## Database Setup

Database schema is located here: [/resources/db_schema.png](/resources/db_schema.png)

These instructions assume Postgres v 14.4 or later is installed.

First create the wings database from the command line by typing:
`createdb wings`

Then connect to the newly created db:
`psql -d wings`

You should get some output that looks like this:

```
psql (14.4)
Type "help" for help.

wings=#
```

At the psql prompt create a user called 'wings' by entering:
`CREATE USER wings;`

If you get this message, then your user has been set up successfully:
`CREATE ROLE`

Now that your database is set up, run `npm run migrate-latest` to create the tables,
and `npm run seed-data` to populate seed data. The seed scripts can be run over and over to restore to the original seed data. If however, you need to re-run the migration, run the following command.

`psql -d wings -f ./db/reset_migrations.sql`

Then you can re-run `npm run migrate-latest`.

## Front-end

Front-end Created with React/HTML/CSS.

Created Routes with --
"import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

This lets the developer create links between pages. Please see "https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6" for a detailed explanation on how to run this.
